hostWin
=======

A simple c# host file editor for windows. This is made as an exercise.

Update 26 october 2012:
Due to schoolwork and personal events, the development was halted for some months.
Now I have some time again and I will start working on it again.
Goals:
-Fix problems due to the migration to a new setup and Visual Studio 2012
-Create a GUI to link the build in functionality to an easy to use environment.
